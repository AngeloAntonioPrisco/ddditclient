## ðŸ“Œ What is it?

**Dddit Client** is the official **Python** client that implements a CLI to consuming the Dddit server's functionalities.
Currently, it supports:

- **FBX models** versioning
- **Materials** versioning, understood as sets of PNG textures  

Main features include:
- Creating and managing **repositories**  
- Handling **resources**, **branches**, and **versions**  
- Each version includes **author**, **comment** and additional metadata  
- A **repository invitations system** to enable collaboration among multiple users on the same repo

## ðŸš€ How to try it

The client is intended to be built as a standalone *.exe*, but it can also be executed directly in **PyCharm**.
